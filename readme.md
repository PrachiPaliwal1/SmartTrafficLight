# Smart Traffic Light Optimization

This project is a smart traffic signal controller built using Python and Pygame. It dynamically adjusts green light durations based on detected traffic density using object detection techniques (YOLO).

## Features
- Detects vehicle density using YOLO
- Calculates optimal green signal durations
- Simulates a traffic intersection using Pygame

## Tools & Tech
- Python
- YOLO object detection
- Pygame
- NumPy, OpenCV
